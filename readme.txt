A plug-in for inline comments on WP blogs

== Description ==

Ever wonder what your readers are thinking as they read? Instead of waiting until the comment section at the end SpeakAbout allows you to gather your readers thoughts through inline-comments. Users highlight text and leave feedback at they read. This feedback is combined into a report which is then sent to the author via email.


== Installation ==

1. Upload plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/speak-about` directory, or install SpeakAbout through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate SpeakAbout through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
3. Add an email address under SpeakAbout settings, as well as customize permissions and highlight color. 



== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How often are emails sent? =

Currently they're set to every three hours. (Note that, technically, this is a minimum of 3 hours. After that time period your site needs to be visited once, by anyone, for the email to then be sent)



== Screenshots ==
1. Users leave comments on a page
